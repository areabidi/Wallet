1. Access FastAPI API Docs UI (Swagger)

Open your browser and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:8001/docs


This is an interactive API explorer where you can see all your endpoints (/signup, /login, /protected, etc.).

You can test your API endpoints right from here by sending requests and checking responses.

2. Access FastAPI Redoc UI (alternative docs)

Go to:

http://127.0.0.1:8001/redoc


This is another style of documentation generated automatically by FastAPI.

3. Your Frontend Pages (HTML/CSS/JS)

Your frontend files (HTML, CSS, JS) are served separately by your frontend server — which you set up with Python’s http.server or some other web server.

If you ran this command inside your frontend folder:

python -m http.server 3000


Then your frontend is accessible at:

http://127.0.0.1:3000


Open this URL in your browser to load your HTML page(s).

4. How frontend and backend talk:

Your frontend JavaScript calls the backend API using URLs like:

http://127.0.0.1:8001/signup


Make sure in your script.js or frontend code, your BASE_URL is set to:

const BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8001";

	When you run this command inside a folder:

python -m http.server 3000


here’s what happens:

It starts a simple HTTP server in the current directory (folder).

This server will serve all the files in that folder and its subfolders over HTTP.

If you open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:3000 (or http://localhost:3000), you’ll see:

If there is an index.html file in that folder, it will automatically serve and display that page.

If no index.html exists, it will show you a directory listing of files/folders in that folder.
